# Jet project


## Some data examples
1. https://github.com/alexlib/3d-ptv-jet-flow
2. https://github.com/alexlib/2D_jet_example

There are numerous open databases and examples of jet flows with PIV, e..g PIV Challenge. It's also possible to create a synthetic or real experiment for the sake of this study. For instance this one : http://piv.de/uncertainty/?page_id=44

## What do we need to do:
1. Preprocess PIV images using local tracer particle density to distinguish between the jet flow and the surrounding (not yet entrained) fluid (add image here)
2. Process PIV using both unmasked and also masked (see 1) PIV images - compare the results. 
3. Analyse jet in two modes: 
  - self-similarity: average velocity along a centerline, profiles of velocity at different distances from the nozzle, normalization with the nozzle, jet width (see 1) as a function of distance, see Pope (Turbulent flows), Tennekes and Lumley (A first course on turbulence), White (Viscous flows), Boundary layer flows (Schlichting) - all the chapters about planar (2D) or axisymmetric, round (also 2D but in a different sense) jets. 
  - entrainment at the edge of the jet and conditional analysis as a function of distance from the interface (see Westerweel work on jets and TNTI)
