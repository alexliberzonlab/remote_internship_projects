# Stereoscopic and 3D OpenPIV version

The idea is to take 3D calibration from OpenPTV www.openptv.net and add it to OpenPIV-Python https://github.com/openpiv/openpiv-python. 
The main advantage of the OpenPIV calibration is that it provides the solution for air-glass-liquid interfaces and actually for a large set of real PIV experiments
